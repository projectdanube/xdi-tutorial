<h1>Step 4: Equivalence</h1>

<p>Whenever an XDI graph contains two context nodes that represent the same entity, the equivalance of these two nodes is 
asserted by a <span class="term">$ref</span> relationship.</p>

<p>In the example graph here the context node with a cloud name and another context name with a cloud number represent the same xdi authority.
The <span class="term">$ref</span> relationship establishes that fact and the inverse is represented by a <span class="term">$is$ref</span> relationship</p>
