<h1>Step 6: Global vs Local</h1>

<p>The XDI graph from the previous example depicted multiple peer root nodes but 
we do not know which particular XDI authority's graph this graph actually represents. 

We also talked about XDI references in an earlier example of this chapter. 

The XDI graph contained many peer root nodes including the <span class="term">owner</span> of this graph. </p>

<p>Assuming that this graph represents that of <span class="code">=alice</span>'s, we will need to assert that the <span class="term">common root node</span>
is equivalent to the <span class="term">peer root node</span> of <span class="code">=alice</span>, i.e. <span class="code">(=alice)</span>.

We do this by adding a <span class="code">$ref</span> relational arc betwen the <span class="term">common root node</span> and 
the <span class="term">peer roote node</span> of <span class="code">=alice</span>.</p>

<p>The XDI reference statement to assert the peer root address of its own common root node is:</p>
<p><span class="code">(=!:uuid:1111)/$ref/</span></p>

<p>The inverse of this relationship is asserted by using the <span class="code">$is$ref</span> relational arc:</p>
<p><span class="code">/$is$ref/(=!:uuid:1111)</span></p>

Please note that the common root node is always denoted by an empty string as shown in the above two XDI statements. 

Thus by establishing that <span class="code">(=!:uuid:1111)</span> is the local peer root node, the other two peer root nodes of <span class="code">(+bob)</span> and <span class="code">(*alice.car)</span> would be remote.

Please note that a cloud number is used for this assertion of the local peer root node. For simplicity, cloud names are retained for the remote peer root nodes.</p>
