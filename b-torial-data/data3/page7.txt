<h1>Step 7: Inner Roots</h1>

<p>An <span class="term">inner root note</span> node represents an inner graph, i.e., a graph-within-a-graph. 

An example of an inner root node would be <span class="code">(=alice/#owns)</span>.</p>

<p>The XDI address of an inner root node will contain two XDI addresses, an XDI subject <span class="code">(=alice)</span> followed by an
XDI relational predicate <span class="code">(#owns)</span>. The XDI statements contained in an inner graph are relative only to that particular inner root node.</p>
