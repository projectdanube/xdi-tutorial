<h1>Step 5: Peer Roots</h1>

<p>An XDI graph may describe relationships that exist between multiple XDI authorities. In the XDI graph from Chapter 1, the
XDI authority <span class="code">=alice</span> is related to other authorities <span class="code">=bob</span> and <span class="code">+acme</span>.</p>

<p>Since the global XDI network is of an inherently distributed nature, the individual XDI graphs of each of these authorities may be stored in different locations.</p>

<p>A <span class="term">peer root node</span> in an XDI graph represents the common root node of another independent XDI graph at a different location, with its own XDI address.</p> 

<p>The XDI address of the peer root node contains a single XDI address representing the XDI authority enclosed in a parenthesis. For example,
<span class="code">=alice</span>'s peer root node would be <span class="code">(=alice)</span> or <span class="code">(=!:uuid:1111)</span>.</p> 

<p>We will now establish that <span class="code">=alice</span>, <span class="code">=bob</span>, <span class="code">+acme</span> are peers with each other by adding 3 peer roots each representing the individual XDI authority to 
the earlier graph.

For simplicity, please note that cloud names are used in this example instead of the cloud numbers to describe the peer root nodes.</p>
