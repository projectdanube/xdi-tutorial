<h1>Step 7: Literal Nodes</h1>

<p>To summarize, there are two basic types of nodes in an XDI graph:
Context nodes and literal nodes. </p>

<p><span class="term">Context nodes</span> can vary in their semantics and fulfill a number of
different functions, such as entities or attributes. But they all
fundamentally behave the same way: They
establish the basic structure of the graph, and they always have
an address.</p>

<p><span class="term">Literal nodes</span> also always have an address in the graph, and they can exist
only under an attribute context node, and they are always leaf nodes in the
graph.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned before, there are three types of arcs
in a graph. So far, we have seen two: Contextual arcs and literal
arcs. Note that without the third type of arc (which we will see in
the next step), a graph would be a strictly hierarchical tree.</p>
