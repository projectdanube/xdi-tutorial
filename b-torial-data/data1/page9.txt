<h1>Step 9: Statements</h1>

<p>An XDI graph can be fully described as a set of statements.
A statement corresponds directly to an arc in the graph, therefore in our
graph we have <span class="term">six</span> statements.
Each statement consists of three parts separated by <span class="code">/</span> characters:
a subject, predicate and object.</p>

<p>For a <span class="term">contextual statement</span>, the subject is the address of a context
node, the predicate is the empty string, and the object is the
contextual arc to the child context node:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">//=alice
//=bob
//+acme
=alice//&lt;#email&gt;
</span>
</p>

<p>For a <span class="term">literal statement</span>, the subject is the address of a context node,
the predicate is <span class="code">&</span>, and the object is the literal data:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">=alice&lt;#email&gt;/&amp;/"alice@email.com"
</span>
</p>

<p>For a <span class="term">relational statement</span>, the subject is the address of a context
node, the predicate is the identifier associated with the relation,
and the object is the address of the target context node:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">=alice/#friend/=bob
</span>
</p>
