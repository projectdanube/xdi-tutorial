<h1>Step 10: Statements</h1>

<p>Listing all statements in a graph is a simple
way to <span class="term">serialize the graph</span> into a string so it
can be stored or transmitted over a network.</p>

<p>Usually not all statements of the graph have to
be serialized in order to fully describe the graph.
Most contextual statements are <span class="term">implied</span> by
other statements.</p>

<p>In our example, even though the graph consists of 
<span class="term">six</span> statements, only <span class="term">three</span> are actually needed
to fully describe the graph. The others are considered to be implied and can therefore be omitted:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">//+acme
=alice&lt;#email&gt;/&amp;/"alice@email.com"
=alice/#friend/=bob
</span>
</p>

<p>Note that the order in which the statements are listed is irrelevant, since there is no inherent
order of arcs in the graph either.</p>

<p>This format of a serialized graph is called the <span class="term">XDI DISPLAY</span> format.</p>
