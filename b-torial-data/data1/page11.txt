<h1>Step 11: JXD</h1>

<p>Another way of serializing an XDI graph is the <span class="term">JXD</span> format:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">[
  {
    "@xdi": {
      "friend": { "@id": "#friend", "@type": "@id" },
      "email": "<#email>"
    },
    "@id": "=alice",
    "email": "alice@email.com",
    "friend": [ "=bob" ]
  },
  {
    "@id": "+acme"
  }
]
</span>
</p>

<p><span class="term">JXD</span> is a JSON-based serialization format for the XDI graph model, designed to combine the simplicity of JSON with the semantic richness of XDI.</p>

<p>The <span class="term">XDI DISPLAY</span> format and <span class="term">JXD</span> format are equivalent in terms of the XDI graphs they describe.</p>
