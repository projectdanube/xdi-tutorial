<h1>Step 1: Advanced Graph Model</h1>

<p>In Tutorial 1, we covered the basics of the XDI Graph Model.
We saw that there are <span class="term">two types of nodes</span> (context nodes and literal nodes),
and <span class="term">three types of arcs</span> (contextual arcs, literal arcs, and relational arcs).</p>

<p>We also saw that context nodes can fulfill different functions, such as
entities or attributes.</p>

<p>In this Tutorial 2, we will cover two further functions context nodes can
assume.</p>
