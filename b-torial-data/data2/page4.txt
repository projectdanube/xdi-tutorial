<h1>Step 4: Members</h1>

<p>To represent <span class="term">unordered members</span>, we use the context symbol for things <span class="code">*</span> together with the immutability symbol <span class="code">!</code>.</p>

<p>To represent <span class="term">ordered members</span>, we use the context symbol for order <span class="code">@</span> together with the relativity symbol <span class="code">~</code>.</p>

<p>In this diagram, the members are ordered and
identified by sequential numbers.</p>

<p>The addresses of the three entity members in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">=alice[#event]@~0
=alice[#event]@~1
=alice[#event]@~2
</span>
</p>
