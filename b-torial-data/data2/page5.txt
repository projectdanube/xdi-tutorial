<h1>Step 5: Members</h1>

<p>This diagram shows an <span class="term">attribute collection</span> with
unordered <span class="term">attribute members</span>.</p>

<p>Entity collections and attribute collections work in very
similar ways. The only difference is that in case of the latter, the
<span class="code">&lt; &gt;</span> symbols are added for
both the collection itself, and for its members.</p>

<p>The addresses of the three attribute members in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">=alice[&lt;#email&gt;]&lt;*!:uuid:4928&gt;
=alice[&lt;#email&gt;]&lt;*!:uuid:2093&gt;
=alice[&lt;#email&gt;]&lt;*!:uuid:8829&gt;
</span>
</p>
