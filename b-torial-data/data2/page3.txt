<h1>Step 3: Members</h1>

<p>Collections contain <span class="term">members</span>.
In this diagram, we have an <span class="term">entity collection</span> containing three
<span class="term">entity members</span>. Each one of them can contain entities and
attributes that describe the given member.</p>

<p>XDI distinguishes between <span class="term">unordered members</span>
and <span class="term">ordered members</span>. In this diagram,
the members are unordered and
identified by UUIDs (shortened here for display
purposes).</p>

<p>The addresses of the three entity members in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">=alice[#event]*!:uuid:7328
=alice[#event]*!:uuid:4439
=alice[#event]*!:uuid:8294
</span>
</p>
