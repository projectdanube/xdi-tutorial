<h1>Step 6: Link Contract</h1>

<p>Every message should contain a reference to a <span class="term">link contract</span>
in the target graph which authorizes the operations the message is
going to perform.</p>

<p>This is modeled as a <span class="code">$do</span> relational
arc on the message:</p>

<p><span class="code">=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:4378/$do/(=alice/=bob)$do</span></p>

<p>The details of link contracts will be covered in a future tutorial.</p>
