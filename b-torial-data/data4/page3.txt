<h1>Step 3: The Structure of an XDI Message</h1>

<p>As has already been mentioned, a message is itself
an XDI graph. To be precise, we actually call this graph a
<span class="term">message envelope</span>, which can contain 
one or more <span class="term">messages</span>.</p>

<p>Messages are modeled as <span class="term">entity members</span>
within an <span class="term">entity collection</span> identified by
<span class="code">[$msg]</span>.</p>

<p>In the example on the left, we have three messages in a
message envelope:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:4378</span></li>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:8377</span></li>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:3290</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The parent entity of a collection of messages is considered
the <span class="term">sender</span> of the messages; in this
case <span class="code">=bob</span>. As we will see later, this is
important for authentication and authorization purposes.</p>
