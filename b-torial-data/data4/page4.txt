<h1>Step 4: The Structure of an XDI Message</h1>

<p>Ordered entity members can be used as well, instead of
unordered entity members:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]@~0</span></li>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]@~1</span></li>
<li><span class="code">=bob[$msg]@~2</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This should be done if the messages have to be executed
in a particular order by the XDI server.</p>

<p>So far, the messages are empty, i.e. they would not do anything
if executed against a target graph.</p>
