<h1>Step 7: Authentication Materials</h1>

<p>Depending on the link contract that is being used, the sender of a
message may have to provide additional data for
<span class="term">authentication</span> purposes.</p>

<p>This is most commonly a <span class="term">secret token</span> (password):</p>

<p><span class="code">=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:4378&lt;$secret&gt;&lt;$token&gt;&/&/"s3cr3t"</span></p>

<p>Authentication materials may also be other kinds of tokens,
or a cryptographic <span class="term">signature</span>.</p>
