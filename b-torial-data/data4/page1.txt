<h1>Step 1: XDI Messaging</h1>

<p>So far we have covered the XDI Graph Model, its fundamental
constructs and syntactical symbols, and how to use them to
express data.</p>

<p><span class="term">XDI Messaging</span> is a mechanism for applying modifications to a 
<span class="term">target graph</span>,
and for requesting data from it. Although this is an abstract
mechanism that can be realized in various ways, typically this means 
that an XDI client sends a message to an XDI server via <span class="term">HTTP POST</span> or <span class="term">WebSocket</span>.</p>

<p>A <span class="term">request message</span> may or may not modify the target graph.</p>

<p>A <span class="term">response message</span> always contains a <span class="term">message result</span>, which may however be empty.</p>

<p>Both the message and the message result are themselves XDI graphs.</p>
