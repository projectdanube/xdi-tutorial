<h1>Step 12: $del on a Target Statement</h1>

<p>When a <span class="code">$del</span> operation is applied to a 
<span class="term">target statement</span>, that statement
is deleted from the target graph. All nodes and arcs that are dependent
on this statement are also deleted automatically.</p>

<p>If the target statement does not exist in the target graph, that is
not considered an error.</p>

<p>Target graph before the message:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">//+acme
=alice/#friend/=bob
</span>
</p>

<p>Message:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">(=bob[$msg]*!:uuid:4378$do/$del)=alice/#friend/=bob
</span>
</p>

<p>Target graph after the message:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">//+acme
//=alice
//=bob
</span>
</p>
